<h1> Current Projects</h1>
 Currently, I am working on three focal projects through multi-method dissertation research. In the first project of my dissertation research, I investigate the emotions related to expressing suicidality online, the role of anonymity, and how this relates to receiving comments and positive votes in a popular content-voting site by analyzing a sample of over 100k posts from a suicide support community. My findings will inform policy makers and practioners of the importance and role of anonymity when discussing sensitive topics, like suicide, with clients and patients, in addition to the array of emotions, outside of depression and sadness, associated with suicidality. The second project of my dissertation focuses on a random sample of posts from 2014-2017. During this time period, suicide mortality rates in the United States increased by 1% per 100,000 people -- exhibiting the largest increase over three year increments since roughly 2000. In this project, I perform a qualitative content analysis to understand "why suicide?" and contribute to our existing knowledge of the vast risk factors associated with suicide mortality. Findings from my work will emphasize the reasons why individuals consider suicide, in addition to the social conditions (e.g., job loss, infidelity, divorce, loss of loved one to suicide, etc.) surrounding these decisions. In the third project of my dissertation, I focus on individuals who have returned to this online community over time, i.e., have written more than one post in this community. By analyzing the networks and conversations of repeat authors, findings from my research will emphasize to practioners examples of success in providing support during times of considering ending one's life.

        In other work, I have analyzed national longitudinal datasets (Add Health and SHARE) to understand suicide ideation among young adults and among older Europeans. My forthcoming and future projects seek to understand suicidality among veterans in the United States by analyzing texts from online communities for veterans specifically. 
  <h2>Dissertation</h2>

 My research centers on understanding online suicide discourse. 
  
<h3>Asking for Help in a Content-Voting Site: Anonymity, Suicidality, and Emotions Online.</h3>
The first part of my dissertation explores how individuals express emotions when discussing suicide online, whether individuals are anonymous in this process, and how this relates to receiving comments and positive votes in an analysis of over 100k posts from 2009 to 2017. 
<h3>Expressing Suicidality Online: Motivations and Social Conditions linked to Self-Disclosed Suicidal Ideation.</h3>
  The second part of my dissertation aims to understand "why suicide" by qualitatively analyzing a sample of posts from 2014-2017, when the rates of suicide increased in the United States 1% per 100,000 people in this time period, the largest 3-year incremental increase since 2000. 
  <h3>Coming, Going, and Here to Help: Network Dynamics of an Online Suicide Community.</h3>
  The third part of my dissertation explores how individuals write about suicide online over time by analyzing the networks of a sample of repeat authors from this online community.
