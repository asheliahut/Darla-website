<p>My research interest in suicidality, specifically in online discussions of suicide, stems from a deep empathy for the human experience. Through my dissertation research I seek to investigate how anonymity affects when individuals participate online to discuss being suicidal (or suicidal tendencies of others). I use a computational social science approach in my analysis of text data and metadata from online posts from a specific suicide support community. For my research I assembled a dataset from an online community. I curated the dataset by implementing Google BigQuery to generate data tables, and wrote several batch files to store the data on my local computer. The raw dataset consists of all posts (n=165,568) and comments (n=1,291,312) from SuicideWatch (a subreddit [or online community] from Reddit.com) spanning the years 2008 to 2017, in addition to a corpus of all authors (N=404,075,269) and the subreddits where they posted from 2005 to 2017. SuicideWatch began as a community in 2008, while Reddit.com started in 2005. I sampled authors in the years prior to to SuicideWatch’s formation to understand how users managed their identity online in Reddit’s beginnings as a community. The current data on suicide mortalities in the United States spans through 2017, and I thus included posts from SuicideWatch to match these national data.  I then wrote a series of Python programs to concatenate, clean, and process the sample of authors using high performance computing at my institution.  I also wrote a Python program to determine whether a given author of an online post is anonymous – i.e., do they only use their handle in the community of study, or do they post elsewhere on the site? It is difficult to determine anonymity online, and while users may indicate their account is anonymous, commonly known as a “throwaway account,” in their text post, this is not true of all users who are masking their identity in a time of crisis. Additionally, anonymity is strongly determined by a username that appears only in this community and nowhere else on Reddit, plus a consideration of an author mentioning their account is anonymous in a post, the level of detail they provide, and whether their username contains any variation of a throwaway.</p>

<p>Making use of sociological theory on suicide, previous research on emotions, and suicide risk prevention information, I develop dictionaries and use regular expressions in Python to code for the occurrence of certain words and emotional language, in addition to creating a measure of suicide risk based on self-reported information in text. I analyze categorical associations between measures using correspondence analysis in R, while also estimating a given post’s number of comments or level of karma using negative binomial regression models in STATA. I also analyze the networks and conversations of repeat authors in R. To gain a deeper understanding of why individuals are considering suicide, I generated a 1% random sample of posts (N=784) from 2014-2017 (when suicide mortality rates experienced a 1% increase per 100,000 people in the United States) for qualitative analysis in ATLAS.ti. Using word searches and regular expressions, I code for age and gender of the authors. To assess themes within posts, I use an inductive approach. I further analyze content of posts by comparing anonymous and non-anonymous authors, repeat authors to one-time authors, and by comparing combinations of social characteristics (age and gender) to discern for any differences in self-disclosed suicide information. In conjunction with the quantitative research, qualitative analyses of text highlight nuance and provide explanatory context for the key results found in the quantitative models. In this component of my research, I explore and analyze the human experience of suffering by engaging a qualitative analysis of an online suicide support community to help understand the rise in suicide rates beyond the more commonplace descriptive demographic analyses of suicide mortality.

<hr>
<p>In other work, I have analyzed national longitudinal datasets (Add Health and SHARE) to understand suicide ideation among young adults and among older Europeans. My forthcoming and future projects seek to understand suicidality among veterans in the United States by analyzing texts from online communities for veterans specifically.</p>
  <h2>Dissertation</h2>
  <h3>Today I Feel Like Dying: Social Validation, Sensitive Topics, and Online Community.</h3>
 My research centers on understanding online suicide discourse. 
  
<h3>Asking for Help in a Content-Voting Site: Anonymity, Suicidality, and Emotions Online.</h3>
The first part of my dissertation explores how individuals express emotions when discussing suicide online, whether individuals are anonymous in this process, and how this relates to receiving comments and positive votes in an analysis of over 100k posts from 2009 to 2017. 
<h3>Expressing Suicidality Online: Motivations and Social Conditions linked to Self-Disclosed Suicidal Ideation.</h3>
  The second part of my dissertation aims to understand "why suicide" by qualitatively analyzing a sample of posts from 2014-2017, when the rates of suicide increased in the United States 1% per 100,000 people in this time period, the largest 3-year incremental increase since 2000. 
  <h3>Coming, Going, and Here to Help: Network Dynamics of an Online Suicide Community.</h3>
  The third part of my dissertation explores how individuals write about suicide online over time by analyzing the networks of a sample of repeat authors from this online community.
