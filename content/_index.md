About Me

Darla is currently a [Doctoral Candidate](https://sociology.arizona.edu/user/darla-still) at The University of Arizona in the School of Sociology. She earned her Master of Arts degree in Sociology at The University of Memphis in December 2014, where she also earned her undergraduate degree.

Darla has a strong passion for finding answers to puzzles through her research skills. As a methodologist and computational social scientist, Darla is able to answer a multitude of research questions by matching each question to an appropriate analytical technique. Darla embraces the challenge of finding patterns in data, but by having a strong understanding of social relationships, Darla has a deeper awareness of human behavior, thus enhancing her empathy for the human experience. 

Darla's current research centers on understanding online suicide discourse. The first part of her dissertation explores how individuals express emotions when discussing suicide online, whether individuals are anonymous in this process, and how this relates to receiving comments and positive votes in an analysis of over 100k posts from 2009 to 2017. The second part of her dissertation aims to understand "why suicide" by qualitatively analyzing a sample of posts from 2014-2017, when the rates of suicide increased in the United States 1% per 100,000 people in this time period, the largest 3-year incremental increase since 2000. The third part of her dissertation explores how individuals write about suicide online over time by analyzing the networks of a sample of repeat authors from this online community.
