<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>{{< image src="https://i.imgur.com/iyUYhTb.jpg" width="50%" align="inline">}}</p>
<p>I am currently a <a href="https://sociology.arizona.edu/user/darla-still">PhD Candidate</a> at <a href="https://sociology.arizona.edu/">The University of Arizona in the School of Sociology</a>. I earned my Master of Arts degree in <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/sociology/graduate/placements.php">Sociology at The University of Memphis</a> in December 2014, where I also earned my undergraduate degree.

    I have a strong passion for finding answers to puzzles through her research skills. As a methodologist and computational social scientist, I am able to answer a multitude of research questions by matching each question to an appropriate analytical technique. I embrace the challenge of finding patterns in data, but by having a strong understanding of social relationships, I have a deeper awareness of human behavior, thus enhancing my empathy for the human experience.

    Currently, I am working on three focal projects through multi-method dissertation research. In the first project of my dissertation research, I investigate the emotions related to expressing suicidality online, the role of anonymity, and how this relates to receiving comments and positive votes in a popular content-voting site by analyzing a sample of over 100k posts from a suicide support community. My findings will inform policy makers and practioners of the importance and role of anonymity when discussing sensitive topics, like suicide, with clients and patients, in addition to the array of emotions, outside of depression and sadness, associated with suicidality. The second project of my dissertation focuses on a random sample of posts from 2014-2017. During this time period, suicide mortality rates in the United States increased by 1% per 100,000 people -- exhibiting the largest increase over three year increments since roughly 2000. In this project, I perform a qualitative content analysis to understand "why suicide?" and contribute to our existing knowledge of the vast risk factors associated with suicide mortality. Findings from my work will emphasize the reasons why individuals consider suicide, in addition to the social conditions (e.g., job loss, infidelity, divorce, loss of loved one to suicide, etc.) surrounding these decisions. In the third project of my dissertation, I focus on individuals who have returned to this online community over time, i.e., have written more than one post in this community. By analyzing the networks and conversations of repeat authors, findings from my research will emphasize to practioners examples of success in providing support during times of considering ending one's life.

        In other work, I have analyzed national longitudinal datasets (Add Health and SHARE) to understand suicide ideation among young adults and among older Europeans. My forthcoming and future projects seek to understand suicidality among veterans in the United States by analyzing texts from online communities for veterans specifically.
