<p><h1>About Darla Still<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iyUYhTb.jpg" height="375" alt="Darla Still" position="inline"></h1>
   I am currently a <a href="https://sociology.arizona.edu/user/darla-still">PhD Candidate</a> at <a href="https://sociology.arizona.edu/">The University of Arizona in the School of Sociology</a>. I earned my Master of Arts degree in <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/sociology/graduate/placements.php">Sociology at The University of Memphis</a> in December 2014, where I also earned my undergraduate degree. 
    I have a strong passion for finding answers to puzzles through my research skills. As a methodologist and computational social scientist, I am able to answer a multitude of research questions by matching each question to an appropriate analytical technique. I embrace the challenge of finding patterns in data, but by having a strong understanding of social relationships, I have a deeper awareness of human behavior, thus enhancing my empathy for the human experience.
